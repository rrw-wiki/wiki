Introduction
============

.. warning::
   Before starting anything, you should already have some basic experience with programming, reverse engineering, setting up servers, and using tools for debugging. Making and running a revival is not easy. It takes a lot of work, time, and problem-solving. If you're just trying to bring back old Roblox for fun without learning the technical side, this project might not be for you.

.. note::
   This wiki and its contents are for educational purposes only. We are not affiliated with Roblox Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Additionally, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any revival projects that may be created using this guide.

Welcome to the **Roblox Revival Wiki**, a guide made to help people understand how to create and run a Roblox revival project. This wiki was made because there's no easy, open, or clear resource that explains how to do this. Most of the information is scattered across the internet, and a lot of the people who know how to do it don't share that knowledge.

This project isn't just about bringing back old Roblox. It's about learning how things worked, saving history, and building something that's fun. But there are also real challenges, like legal issues, broken tools, and toxic communities. That's why this wiki also talks about the problems and how we can make the revival scene better for everyone.

What Is a Revival?
-------------------

For those who are unaware, a revival is a fan-made recreation of an older version of Roblox. These projects usually bring back classic features, games, and UI from the past, sometimes as far back as 2006. Revivals often use original Roblox clients (with minor changes) and connect them to custom servers that recreate how Roblox used to work.

What This Wiki Covers
----------------------

This wiki will teach you how to:

- Understand Roblox clients and old versions
- Host and run old Roblox clients safely
- Rebuild key features like login, assets, and friends
- Reverse engineer how Roblox used to work
- Store and share old games and assets
- Run a working server with users
- Keep things safe and stable
- Handle legal and ethical issues
- Build a friendly community around your project
- Learn about tools, examples, and useful projects


Why This Wiki Exists
---------------------

There are two main reasons for this wiki:

1. **To help new people get started.** Right now, it's hard to find help unless you already know people or dig through random code and dead links. A lot of people in the community gatekeep, they keep information to themselves, act like they're better than others, or try to block newcomers from learning. This wiki is here to change that by offering clear and helpful info in one place.

2. **To speak up about problems in the community.** The revival scene has some serious issues. There's drama, egos, and people who care more about control than helping others. We want to be honest about these problems and help make the space more open, kind, and respectful.

If you really want to make a Roblox revival, and you're ready to learn and put in the work, this guide will help you every step of the way. And even if you're just curious about how Roblox used to work, that's great too. You're welcome here.

How This Wiki Is Structured
----------------------------

This wiki focuses on **concepts and workflows**, not forcing you into a specific programming language or framework. Revival development can be done in many ways, whether you're using Node.js, Python, PHP, Rust, C#, or something else entirely. The tools and examples we mention are just that: examples.

You'll find general explanations of how the systems work (like login endpoints, asset loading, or client patching), and you're free to implement them however makes the most sense for your setup. The main thing that matters is that your implementation **talks to the client in the way it expects**, which depends on the version of the client you're targeting.

Where needed, we may include multiple examples or mention alternatives. If a section looks tied to a certain tech stack, it's only because that's what the example used, not because it's required.

Contributing
-------------

We are actively looking for contributors! If you have knowledge, tools, or corrections to share, or even just want to help improve the writing, please submit a pull request or open an issue on our GitHub repository. Your contributions will help make this wiki better for everyone.
