Introduction
============

.. warning::
   Before starting anything, you should already have some basic experience with programming, reverse engineering, setting up servers, and using tools for debugging. Making and running a revival is not easy. It takes a lot of work, time, and problem-solving. If you're just trying to bring back old Roblox for fun without learning the technical side, this project might not be for you.

Welcome to the **Roblox Revival Wiki**, a guide made to help people understand how to create and run a Roblox revival project. This wiki was made because there's no easy, open, or clear resource that explains how to do this. Most of the information is scattered across the internet, and a lot of the people who know how to do it don't share that knowledge.

This project isn't just about bringing back old Roblox. It's about learning how things worked, saving history, and building something that's fun. But there are also real challenges — like legal issues, broken tools, and toxic communities. That's why this wiki also talks about the problems and how we can make the revival scene better for everyone.

What This Wiki Covers
----------------------

This wiki will teach you how to:

- Understand Roblox clients and old versions
- Host and run old Roblox clients safely
- Rebuild key features like login, assets, and friends
- Reverse engineer how Roblox used to work
- Store and share old games and assets
- Run a working server with users
- Keep things safe and stable
- Handle legal and ethical issues
- Build a friendly community around your project
- Learn about tools, examples, and useful projects

Why This Wiki Exists
---------------------

Why This Wiki Exists
---------------------

There are two main reasons for this wiki:

1. **To help new people get started.** Right now, it's hard to find help unless you already know people or dig through random code and dead links. A lot of people in the community gatekeep — they keep information to themselves, act like they're better than others, or try to block newcomers from learning. This wiki is here to change that by offering clear and helpful info in one place.

2. **To speak up about problems in the community.** The revival scene has some serious issues. There's drama, egos, and people who care more about control than helping others. We want to be honest about these problems and help make the space more open, kind, and respectful.

If you really want to make a Roblox revival — and you're ready to learn and put in the work — this guide will help you every step of the way. And even if you're just curious about how Roblox used to work, that's great too. You're welcome here.
