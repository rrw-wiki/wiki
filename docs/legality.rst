Legal Notice
============

Before getting too deep into building a revival, it's important to understand the legal risks. While Roblox revivals exist in a **legal gray area**, that doesn't mean they're completely safe or protected.

What the Law Says
------------------

Roblox Corporation owns the Roblox client, branding, assets, and infrastructure, past and present. Even if you're using an older version of the client, it's still covered under their intellectual property (IP). Most revival projects don't have permission to redistribute Roblox clients, assets, or to mimic their services.

That said, **there are no public laws or statements that explicitly ban private revivals**, but that doesn't mean you're in the clear. It just means enforcement is rare and handled privately.

Cease and Desist (C&D) History
-------------------------------

There have been several cases where Roblox has sent **Cease and Desist (C&D)** letters to revival projects in the past. Some of these projects shut down, while others went quiet or changed how they operated. Some however, were complete hoaxes and shutdown for unrelated reasons.

Roblox does not seem to go after **every** revival, and most projects, especially smaller or private ones, tend to fly under the radar. Still, it has happened before, and it could happen again.

What Are the Risks?
--------------------

Running a revival could put you at risk of:

- Receiving a C&D letter from Roblox
- Having your project taken offline by your host
- DMCA takedowns of code, binaries, or media
- Legal action (extremely rare, but not impossible)

You are **fully responsible** for your actions if you choose to run or publish a revival.

How to Stay Safer
-------------------

Here are a few general tips to reduce your risk:

- Don't monetize your revival or ask for donations, that's a quick way to get noticed
- Don't use Roblox logos, names, or branding
- Keep it private, or only share among trusted people

Final Word
-----------

This wiki is for **educational and historical purposes**. It does not promote piracy or the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted software. 

Additionally, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any revival projects that may be created using this guide.

You are running your revival project at your **own risk**.

If you're not comfortable with that, it's totally okay to walk away. Better safe than sorry.
